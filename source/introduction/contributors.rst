This documentation was built collectively by the Ethereum community as part of
a project called the
`Homestead Documentation Initiative <https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/45116k/call_to_action_homestead_documentation_initiative/>`_
which was coordinated by:

- `Hudson Jameson ("Souptacular") <https://github.com/Souptacular>`_
- `Viktor Trón ("zelig") <https://github.com/zelig>`_
- `Hugh Lang <https://github.com/hughlang>`_
