Đ   Đ, D with stroke, is a letter used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic and Faroese that stands for Eth, and not for D as in “Distibuted”. See Đapp.   Eth
Đapp  As said above, Đ stands for Eth and Đapp is the name used for a Contract, a distributed application, run on the Ethereum network. It's a word game mixing the Eth for Ethereum with the D for Distributed, attached to app for Application. It is pronounced Ethapp.

Epoch
  Epoch is the interval between each regeneration of the DAG used as seed by the PoW algorithm Ethash. The epoch in specified as 30000 blocks.

nonce
  Number User Once or Number Once

A nonce, in information technology, is a number generated for a specific use, such as session authentication. Typically, a nonce is some value that varies with time, although a very large random number is sometimes used. In general usage, nonce means “for the immediate occasion” or “for now.”

In the case of Blockchain Proof of Work scenarios, the hash value, found by a Miner, matching the network's Difficulty thus proving the Block Validity is called Nonce as well.

uncle
  Uncles are blockchain blocks found by a miner, when different miner has already found another block for the corresponding place in the blockchain. They are called “stale blocks”. The parent of an Uncle is an ancestor of the inserting block, located at the tip of the blockchain.

  In contrast to the Bitcoin network, Ethereum rewards stale blocks as well in order to avoid to penalise miners with a bad connection to the network. This is less critical In the Bitcoin network, because the Block Time there is much higher (~10 minutes) than on the Ethereum network (aimed to ~15 seconds, Frontier).

DAG   DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph. It is a graph, a set of nodes and links between nodes, that has very special properties.

Ethereum uses a DAG in Ethash, the Ethereum Proof of Work (POW) algorithm. The Ethash DAG takes a long time to be generated, which is done by a Miner node into a cache file for each Epoch. The file data is then used when a value from this graph is required by the algorithm.  Directed Acyclic Graph

Obsolete Terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO
  put this into the glossary marked as obsolete `

HLL
  Acronym for Higher Level Language, which is what Serpent and Solidity are. HLL is what early Ðapp developers called Ethereum programming languages that did not touch the low level elements. This phrase has been phased out.

CLL
  Acronym for C Like Language, which Mutan was. This acronym has been phased out.

ES1, ES2, and ES3
  "Ethereum Script" versions 1,2 and 3. There were early versions of what would become the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
