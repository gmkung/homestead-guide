^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO
  put this into the glossary marked as obsolete `

HLL
  Acronym for Higher Level Language, which is what Serpent and Solidity are. HLL is what early √êapp developers called Ethereum programming languages that did not touch the low level elements. This phrase has been phased out.

CLL
  Acronym for C Like Language, which Mutan was. This acronym has been phased out.

ES1, ES2, and ES3
  "Ethereum Script" versions 1,2 and 3. There were early versions of what would become the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
