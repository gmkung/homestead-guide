History of Ethereum
********************************************************************************

Inception
================================================================================
Ethereum was initially described by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 as a result of his research and work in the Bitcoin community. Shortly thereafter, Vitalik published the `Ethereum white paper <http://vbuterin.com/ethereum.html>`_, where he describes in detail the technical design and rationale for the Ethereum protocol and smart contracts architecture. In January 2014, Ethereum was formally announced by Vitalik at the The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida, USA. From that moment on, the excitement around Ethereum and the its momentum has grown at a dramatic pace.

Around that time, Vitalik also started working with Dr. Gavin Wood and together co-founded Ethereum. By April 2014, Gavin published the `Ethereum Yellow Paper <http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf>`_ that would serve as the technical specification for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By following the detailed specification in the Yellow Paper, the Ethereum client has been implemented in six programming languages (C++, Go, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Haskell), and has resulted in better software overall.

The Ethereum Foundation and Presale
================================================================================
In addition to developing the software for Ethereum, the ability to launch a new cryptocurrency and blockchain requires a massive bootstrapping effort in order to assemble the resources needed to get it up and running. To kickstart a large network of developers, miners, investors, and other stakeholders, Ethereum announced its plan to conduct a presale of ether tokens, the currency unit of Ethereum. The legal and financial complexities of raising funds through a presale led to the creation of several legal entities, including the Stiftung Ethereum (Ethereum Suisse), established in June 2014 in Zug, Switzerland.

Beginning in July 2014, Ethereum distributed the initial allocation of ether via a 42-day public ether presale, netting 31,591 bitcoins, worth $18,439,086 at that time, in exchange for about 60,102,216 ether. The results of the sale were initially used to pay back mounting legal debts and also for the months of developer effort that had yet to be compensated, and to finance the ongoing development of the Ethereum.

Ethereum Dev
================================================================================
Following the successful ether presale, Ethereum development was formalized under a non-for-profit organization called Ethereum DEV (also known as ETH DEV), which manages the development of Ethereum under contract from Ethereum Suisse – with Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilcke as the 3 directors of the organization. Developer interest in Ethereum grew steadily throughout 2014 and the ETH DEV team delivered a series of proof-of-concept (PoC) releases for the development community to evaluate. Frequent posts by ETH DEV team on the  `the Ethereum blog <https://blog.ethereum.org>`_ also kept the excitement and momentum around Ethereum going.

DEVcon-0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In November 2014, ETH DEV organized the `DEVcon-0 event <https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/05/d%CE%BEvcon-0-recap/>`_, which brought together Ethereum developers from around the world to Berlin to meet and discuss a diverse range of Ethereum technology topics. Several of the presentations and sessions at DEVcon-0 would later drive important initiatives to make Ethereum more reliable, more secure, and more scalable. Overall, the event galvanized developers as they continued to work towards the launch of Ethereum.

ETH DEV Bounty Hunters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In early 2015, a bug bounty program was launched through `ETH DEV Bounty Hunters website <http://bounty.ethdev.com/>`_ offering BTC rewards for finding vulnerabilities in any part of the Ethereum software stack. This has undoubtedly contributed to the reliability and security of Ethereum and the confidence of the Ethereum community in the technology. The bounty program is currently still active and there is no end date planned.

DEVgrants program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In April 2015, `the DEVgrants program <https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help/>`_ was announced, which is a program that offers funding for contributions both to the Ethereum platform, and to projects based on Ethereum. Hundreds of developers were already contributing their time and thinking to Ethereum projects and in open source projects. This program served to reward and support those developers for their contributions. The DEVgrants program continues to operate today and funding of the program was recently renewed in January 2016.

Security Audit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ethereum security audit began at the end of 2014 and continued through the first half of 2015. Ethereum engaged multiple third party software security firms to conduct an end-to-end audit of "everything" (from networking to the Ethereum VM to syncing layer to Proof-of-Work, etc). The audits uncovered security issues that were addressed and tested again, but ultimately resulted in a more secure platform.

The Ethereum Frontier Launch
=======================================================================
The Ethereum Frontier network launched on July 30th, 2015, and developers began writing smart contracts and decentralized apps to deploy on the live Ethereum network. In addition, miners began to join the Ethereum network to help secure the Ethereum blockchain and earn ether from mining blocks. Even though the Frontier release is the first milestone in the Ethereum project and was intended for use by developers as a beta version, it turned out to be more capable and reliable than anyone expected, and developers have rushed in to build solutions and improve the Ethereum ecosystem.

DEVCON1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `DEVCON1 <https://devcon.ethereum.org/>`_ event took place in London at the beginning of November 2015, and the Ethereum community was growing fast and not just among  developers. The event was attended by nearly 400 people, and the audience and presentations contained a mix of developers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, and business executives.

Following the Ethereum launch, a growing number of news articles were published that signaled the increasing popularity of Ethereum. As a next generation blockchain with a complete, built-in programming language, it also attracted the interest of both large companies and startups. One of those companies was Microsoft, which announced that it would offer Ethereum on its new Blockchain as a Service offering on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. In conjunction with DEVCON1, this announcement will be remembered as the moment when blockchain technology became mainstream, with Ethereum at the center of it.
