The planed
Release Step One: Frontier

Release Step Two: Homestead

Release Step Three: Metropolis

Release Step Four: Serenity


While the original plan `laid out before Frontier <https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/>`_ is still valid, the substance behind that thinking chamged somewhat.
As the Olympic testnet phase (before Frontier release) saw a lot of major improvements, Frontier was launched right after not including quite a few caveat features (lower mining reward, mae). Naturally then Homestead was meant to be the real deal finally launching Ethereum network improving upon Frontier's wild west and bringing stability and reliability to the network. Our hope is that Homestead delivers on this promise no matter how high the bar is set already.

Homestead comes with a [bunch of protocol] changes.
* The VM is augmented with a few new import.
* EIP-8 is implemented improving the peer discovery protocol

Homestead will be introduced automatically as per Piper Mirriam's alarm clock at block number #?
